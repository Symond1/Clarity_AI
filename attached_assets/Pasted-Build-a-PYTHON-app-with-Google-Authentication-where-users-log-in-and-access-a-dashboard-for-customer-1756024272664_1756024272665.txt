Backend (Express + MongoDB):

Store users, tickets, negotiation logs.

Google OAuth for login.

REST APIs for dispute tickets.

Frontend (React):

Google login.

Dashboard showing dispute tickets (title, description, value).

Each ticket shows: AI proposal (refund/discount/deny), ethical compliance score, and ‚ÄúApprove / Override‚Äù buttons for humans.

AI Agents (Portia + OpenAI):

Planning Agent: Analyze ticket ‚Üí apply company policy ‚Üí draft resolution.

Execution Agent: If low risk ‚Üí auto-resolve, else flag to human.

Use OpenAI for reasoning + ethical scoring.

Store all outcomes in MongoDB.

MVP Demo:

Pre-load 10‚Äì15 fake dispute tickets in MongoDB.

When user logs in ‚Üí dashboard fetches tickets.

Portia AI generates proposal + compliance score for each.

Human can override decisions via frontend.

Optional: Email/Slack alert for high-risk cases.
